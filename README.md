# Dotfiles using GNU Stow

I'm rewriting my dotfiles to take advantage of GNU Stow.

## Plans

- [ ] Add Brewfile w/ some packages
  - [ ] mise - (general language & tool version manager)
  - [ ] fd - Fast Rust replacement for `find`
  - [ ] rg - Fast Rust replacement for `grep`
- [ ] Use mise for all version management (ditch bob-nvim)
- [ ] Add an rg config for ignoring files in mini.pick
- [ ] Create a NeoVim config from scratch with AI goodness
- [ ] Decide on a shell (zsh, fish, or nu), and add that config
- [ ] Add Ghostty config (doubt I'll switch terminals)
- [ ] Upgrade to neovim v0.11 and remove duplicative plugins
- [ ] Figure out a Nerd Font installation solution (Geist Mono NF)
- [ ] Add an rc file for my chosen shell (including RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH)
